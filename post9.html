      Wi-Fi is reliable until the moment it matters. Then it slows down, disconnects,
      or pretends it never existed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reloading the page doesn’t help. Neither does restarting the router. Somehow,
      the problem resolves itself five minutes after you stop caring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Speed tests will claim everything is fine. Reality disagrees.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wi-Fi isn’t broken. It’s just emotionally unavailable.
