      Loading screens are strange. We stare at them even though nothing is happening.
      Progress bars move, tips scroll by, and we pretend it helps.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bar that jumps from 0% to 90% instantly is lying to you. The one that pauses
      at 99% is testing your patience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tips on loading screens are rarely useful. You’ve already seen them. Yet you
      read them anyway, because there’s nothing else to do.
