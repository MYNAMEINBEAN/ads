      Dark mode started as an option. A toggle. A convenience. Somewhere along the way,
      it became a permanent way of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you enable dark mode, light mode becomes offensive. Blinding. Almost rude.
      Opening a white webpage at night feels like staring directly into the sun.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s not just about aesthetics either. Dark mode feels faster, cleaner, more
      focused. Code looks better. Text feels calmer. Even mistakes feel more acceptable
      when they’re surrounded by dark gray.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dark mode isn’t just a theme. It’s a statement.
