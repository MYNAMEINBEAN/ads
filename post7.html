      You go to sleep with five tabs open. You wake up with twenty-three.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some tabs are useful. Some are questions you no longer remember asking. One is a
      documentation page from six hours ago that you’re afraid to close.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tabs represent unfinished thoughts. Closing them feels like admitting defeat.
    </p>

    <p>
