      When code works the first time, something feels wrong. You don’t trust it.
      You test it again. And again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bugs usually announce themselves loudly. When nothing breaks, suspicion sets in.
      Did you miss something? Is it silently failing?
    </p>

    <p>
      The rare moment when everything works perfectly feels less like success and more
      like borrowed luck.
    </p>

    <p>
      You save the file anyway. Just in case.
