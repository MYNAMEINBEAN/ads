      Somewhere in every house exists a drawer filled with USB cables. No one knows
      where they came from. Some are ancient. Some look brand new. None of them seem
      to fit the device you actually need to charge.
    </p>

    <p>
      USB-A to mini-USB. Micro-USB. USB-C. C-to-C. C-to-A. That one cable that feels
      important but hasn’t been used since 2014. You keep them all because throwing
      one away feels like tempting fate.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real mystery isn’t why we have so many cables — it’s why the exact one you
      need is never in the drawer when you reach for it. The drawer somehow knows.

      Maybe one day historians will find these drawers and assume USB cables were a
      form of currency. Honestly, that would explain a lot.
