      Mechanical keyboards are divisive. Some hear noise. Others hear music.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each switch has a personality. Clicky. Tactile. Linear. Choosing one becomes
      strangely personal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sound becomes feedback. A rhythm. A confirmation that something is happening.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s not about being loud. It’s about being intentional.
